# [ info ]

Free version of [Zamorozka Client](https://zamorozka.fun) provided by people for people

Since it just released, we thought we could help developers find bugs by making a free version of their software

That way developers will get more bug reports, which means that developers will fix them, which means that the software will get better over time!

The client itself isn't for anarchy servers but it should be good on minigames and sword HvH servers. Also it looks great.

# [ how-to ]
Unlike our other releases, this one requires specific versions of Java and Fabric to be installed (client's problem)

</div>

+ LATEST Java 8 (although 8u241 works just fine, find it online or [click here](https://mega.nz/file/fOoEAQBa#xowIZlFHlfhGLI-XlBGyvx2OkC856r3jaAOt3hewJkw))
+ A bit old version of Fabric (0.11.7 works, you can use [MultiMC](https://multimc.org) to get that)
+ [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886) (don't know if version matters but it works on 0.41.3)

So how do you install this client?

</div>

1. Download package.zip from the releases page
0. Put zhook.jar into your .minecraft folder
0. Put Zamorozka.jar into your .minecraft/mods folder
0. Add "-Xbootclasspath/p:zhook.jar" to your JVM arguments ([MultiMC](https://i.imgur.com/aCOCnnp.png) / [TL & TLauncher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56c3CYL-qnw) (type -Xbootclasspath... instead of noverify))
0. Start the game
0. When you're at the login screen type any password and press login

# [ issues ]

</div>

+ If you get crashed due to google gson then make sure your Fabric version is old (check how-to)
+ If you press login and it does nothing but makes your screen red then make sure you added -Xbootclasspath... to your JVM arguments (check how-to)
+ If you get crashed ingame then it's the client's problem and I can't help you with that
